# Hackathon Project Ideas (Round 2: AI Performance Analysis)

Theme: "Nichely Brilliant" - AI that listens/watches and coaches you.

## 1. The Feynman Mirror (The "Explain Like I'm 5" Tester)
**The Concept:** The best way to learn is to teach. You choose a topic (e.g., "Photosynthesis") and explain it out loud to the AI.
**The AI's Role:** It doesn't just check facts. It analyzes your **logic flow, analogies, and confidence**.
**The Feedback:** "You used a lot of jargon here without defining it," or "Your analogy about the factory didn't quite work because..."
**Why it's brilliant:** It automates the "Feynman Technique." It's a study buddy that actually listens.
**Tech:** React (Voice Recording), OpenAI Whisper (STT), Gemini/GPT-4 (Logic Analysis).

## 2. "Pitch Perfect" (Debate/Public Speaking Coach)
**The Concept:** Similar to BriteSpeech but for **persuasion**. You record an argument or speech.
**The AI's Role:** It detects logical fallacies (Ad Hominem, Strawman) and "weak language" in real-time.
**The Feedback:** A "Persuasion Score." Highlights specific sentences: "This was a slippery slope argument."
**Why it's brilliant:** Great for debate clubs, law students, or anyone trying to win an argument.
**Tech:** Audio analysis, NLP for logical fallacy detection.

## 3. "Interview Judo" (Adaptive Mock Interviewer)
**The Concept:** A mock interview where the AI adapts its personality based on your answers.
**The AI's Role:** If you sound confident, it gets tougher/grumpier. If you stutter, it becomes encouraging (or more aggressive, depending on mode).
**The Feedback:** Analyzes your **emotional resilience** and ability to pivot. "You crumbled when I asked about your weakness."
**Why it's brilliant:** Simulates the *pressure* of an interview, not just the questions.

## 4. "Lingo Lock" (Accent/Dialect Coach for Actors/Spies)
**The Concept:** You want to sound like you're from 1920s New York or modern London.
**The AI's Role:** You speak, and it gives a heat map of your pronunciation errors specific to that dialect.
**The Feedback:** "Your vowels were too flat for a Boston accent."
**Why it's brilliant:** Very niche, very fun demo.
